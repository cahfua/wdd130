            <p>   Hello! I'm Celestine Ahfua, and I'm so glad you're here. 
               Born in Torrance, California, I was raised in the Salt Lake City area before moving to Apia, Samoa in 2019.
               I'm Currently back in West Jordan, Utah until early next year. 
               As the youngest of five (with three brothers and one sister!), family is at the heart of everything I do.
                  I'm driven by a passion for web and app development. My goal is to deliver high-quality digital services that support both large corporations and local businesses in Samoa.
               I believe technology should be accessible and empowering for communities of all sizes. Ultimately, my dream is to master software development and transition
               into teaching, sharing knowledge and inspiring the next generation of developers.
                  When I'm not coding or learning new frameworks, you'll find me indulging in all types of hobbies such as,
               fishing, crocheting, reading, pickleball, volleyball, baking etc. These activities keep me both balanced and curious, allowing me to obtain creative qualities I try to bring into every project.
